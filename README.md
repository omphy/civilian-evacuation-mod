Realistic Damage and Civilian Evacuation is a mod that enhances the devastation of war by introducing new levels of destruction to both a countries industrial capabilities and civilian's willingness to stay.

I would like to mention that this mod does NOT include civilian casualties nor war crimes or anything in that direction, and if you want to have civilian deaths you will have to look elsewhere.
We should respect the fallen of war, both soldiers and civilian.

This mod features as of 0.1.1:
## Civilians
Civilian exodus due to (losing a) war, you have events for people fleeing the country, but also people fleeing states.
Civilian exodus due to enemy bomber planes
Civilian exodus due to nuclear explosions
## Economic and political damage
Nukes can now destroy buildings rather than just damaging them
Nukes permanently lower war support by quite a bit
Immigrants will lower stability very lightly

Again, this mod does not add civilian casualties, nor war crimes. And I don't support war crimes neither. This is simply a mod that adds it so civilians flee states for realistic purposes.
